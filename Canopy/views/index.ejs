    <h1>The Canopy Project</h1>
    <p>The Earth's rainforests are under threat.<br>Rainforests are home to 50% of the world's plant and animal species and play a vital role
      in regulating the climate.<br>They are disappearing at an alarming rate.</p>
    <h2>In 40 years, they could be <b>gone.</b></h2>
    <p>Illegal logging in The Amazon, The Congo and the Rainforests of South East Asia are responsible for much of this decline, where 
      it accounts for between 61% and 72% of logging activity in these areas.
